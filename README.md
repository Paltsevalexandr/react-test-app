Description

A simple React application for testing and demonstration purposes.
It is simulates a production line time tracking system. This application will help workers 
track the duration of a build process, enter production defects, and manage extended work 
time after the scheduled duration has passed.

## Getting Started

Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Paltsevalexandr/react-test-app.git 
cd react-test-app

Install dependencies: 
npm install


Running the App
npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000] with your browser to see the result.


Using the app
The app has 3 users and 3 builds:
1. login id: user1, build number 1
2. login id: user2, build number 2
3. login id: user3, build number 3

I made different time_per_part and number_of_parts so 
you will have different total time of the timer for testing:
1. 5 minutes
2. 1 minute
3. 21 minutes
